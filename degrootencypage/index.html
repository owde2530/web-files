      <p> In the age of Westward expansion in the United States, in the mid 19th century to early 20th century,<br>

        herded cattle over long distances, on a seasonsal basis. At the time, this was considered a respectable and<br>
        commonplace job. However, with time, the job took on a more nebulous role of that of the pioneer, the bandit,<br>
        all morphed into this general conception of "cowboy."</p>
