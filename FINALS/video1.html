        <h2><em>Julius Caesar High School</em> (writer/director, 2016) </h2>

        <p class="videop">For my final high shcool video production class, students were tasked
        with making a short film that imitates a famous film director's style. I chose Wes Anderson, as he's
        a bit of a favorite of mine, and I've been watching his movies for a while. In particular, I took a lot of
        inspiration from <em>Rushmore</em>.
        The story follows a high school student bullied and ostracized by
        most of the other kids in his class. He gets fed up, and, in a glorious display of rebellion,
        he decides to humiliate his prime bully in the middle of a crowded passing
        period. Definitely Wes Anderson, but with a surprisingly dark side to it as well,
        I'd definitely say this is one of my favorite pieces I've made so far.</p>
