<!-- Anywhere on teh web that you see is horizontally formatted, and it also helps with formatting, and...all that. -->
<!-- It can also be done vertically - also, if the page is in card view, it can help with that, too.  -->
<!-- Self-human - stuff they can do per week daily that can help them better themselves and what not, you know? Like...
For instance - on Sunday, you can do the dishes, call a friend, etc. -->
<!-- Basically, just build an interactive menu. -->
<!-- So, this week, create three to five items, of being a better human, person, etc. etc. - other assignemtn will be making a
quote machine,dude. Make it themed, as well. Also can make an image server, as well. -->
