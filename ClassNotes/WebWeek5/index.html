Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

    <!-- Box Model - create a body, it has a width and a height. So...yea. You can also do that with images,
    and generall you're going to want to do that with CSS. First way to do that is with borders, onvbiously.
    Margin: space between this element, and then any others, too. Padding - kind o flike inside margin, basically.
    It pushes text and shit IN towards the inside area. Text/elements won't get closer to edge than the width
    of the padding.  -->

    entry, portfolio, about me, or new file -  -->

<!-- While borders and margins can make things look nice, it can be complicated and there's a lot that can go wrong.
So, make sure to use inspector tool. And, then, yea. -->
