Abstraction (make more categores), Encapsulation (havet these categories still be consice, in their own way), Polymorphism (adapt these categories), Inheritance (constructors canbe used as parts of other constructors)
Objects are not ordered - so, you would never access anything with data[0] data.widget.debug (use that instead)
