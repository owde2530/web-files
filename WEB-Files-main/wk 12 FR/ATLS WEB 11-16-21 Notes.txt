TF do you mean dude - 

CSS and Javascript - 
Round Up ?????? Retrospective (shit we've learned but really haven't like learned formally I guess lmao haha) 

Cascading Style Sheets - 
* Cascading Style Sheets s0rt the style of information based on several key factors to decide which one to ultimately display. The rules depend on the following macros:
	* Origin and !Important
		* Origin: Who is changing the document?
			1. Browser !important
			2. User !important
			3. Author !important
			4. Author
			5. User
			6. Browser (go without any styling to browser, THAT is browser styling - boring milquetoast-ass shit.)
(Third party style libraries will often use important for their styling, tbh) 
	* Selectors by Specifity
	The more specific the CSS selector is, the higher it ranks in the final result. 
		1. !important
		2. Inline
		3. ID
		4. Class
		5. Element/Tag
	* Source Order
	Whichever rule comes LAST will be the one that is RENDERED

Javascript DOM Selectors - 
How we access parts of the DOM (document object model) inside of our code.

1. document.getElementsByTagName()
2. document.getElementByClassName()
3. document.getElementById()
4. Document.querySelector()
5. document.querySelectorAll()

<img src="assets/image.jpg" alt="" id="myimg" class="pics">

1. document.getELementsByTagName("img")[n]
2. document.getElementsByClassName("pics")[n]
3. document.getELementById("myimg")


DOM selector + DOM property = value

document.getElementsByTagName("img)[n] + style.display

1.document.querySelector(".pics") or
document.querySelector("#myimg") or
document.querySelector("img")
2. document.querySelectorAll("img")[n]
(Main reason to use query selector is so that you can access all the fucking options, lmfao)


Usually, then you make it as - 
Let picture = document.getElementsByTagName("img")[n];
picture.style.display = none;
(Typically, you will see getElementByID more - you know that ID will always access that same element, and not another random one) 

CSS transitions vs CSS Animations

Transitions go from one state to the other - Animations go between many states

Transitions use the property to be changed ie button:hover - animations use keyframes to break down the animation

Transitions use pre-made structure (easy but limited) - Animations build their own movements from scratch
